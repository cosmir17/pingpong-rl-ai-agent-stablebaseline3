# AI Ping Pong Agent

This repository contains an AI agent that plays the classic game of Ping Pong. The agent was trained using the Stable Baselines3 library and the RecurrentPPO algorithm.

## Game

The Ping Pong game used for training and testing the AI agent was created by David and can be found in his GitHub repository:

## AI Agent

The AI agent was trained using the following:

- **Library:** Stable Baselines3 & Stable Baselines3 Contrib
- **Algorithm:** RecurrentPPO (Proximal Policy Optimization with Recurrent Neural Networks)

The agent learns to play Ping Pong by interacting with the game environment and optimizing its policy to maximize the reward it receives.

## Agent Performance
